# ViRtus: A Virtual Reality Application for Training and Performance Analysis

## Overview

ViRtus is a Virtual Reality (VR) application designed for training individuals in constructing an electrical control panel. It tracks users' movements and exports their performance metrics into a `.txt` file for statistical analysis using Python. Developed with open-source tools and frameworks, ViRtus enhances immersive training through advanced VR technologies, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and Serious Game - Gamification techniques.

In this case study, we designed and developed an immersive VR training application called ViRtus, a VR-based system framework with a serious game approach for VR-aided personnel training. We applied it to a real-world scenarioâ€”the construction of an electrical control panel. To demonstrate the effectiveness and sustainability of the proposed VR training system, we conducted an experimental study assessing results and showcasing the impact of such applications.

Using beta testers, qualitative assessments from questionnaires, and practical experiments with end users, we concluded that a hybrid training methodâ€”combining a trainer with the VR application as a supplementary toolâ€”can improve usersâ€™ skills, effectively leading to a more productive and sustainable workplace while reducing the trainerâ€™s interaction time with the trainee.
